        No! I'm not talking about cookies that you eat. I'm talking about cookies on your computer.
        Cookies are text files with small pieces of data — like a username and password — that are 
        used to identify your computer as you use a computer network. Specific cookies known as HTTP 
        cookies are used to identify specific users and improve your web browsing experience.
    </p>

    <p>
        Data stored in a cookie is created by the server upon your connection. This data is labeled with
        an ID unique to you and your computer.
    </p>

    <p>
        When the cookie is exchanged between your computer and the network server, the server reads the 
        ID and knows what information to specifically serve to you.
